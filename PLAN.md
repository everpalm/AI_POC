# Human-AI Collaborative Python CI/CD Pipeline Plan

## 1. Workflow Overview

### Human-AI Collaboration & Consistency Check

- User uploads/updates `requirements.md` and/or code (with possible placeholders) in the repo.
- n8n workflow is triggered.
- n8n (via OpenAI API) checks if the repo's code structure and functionality are consistent with `requirements.md`:
    - Identifies missing classes/methods/functions.
    - Detects placeholders (with docstrings specifying arguments, output, error handling).
    - Reports inconsistencies or missing elements.
- Human can add/adjust placeholders as needed.
- AI fills in the implementation for placeholders, ensuring docstring contracts are met.

### Push & CI/CD

- n8n pushes updated code to GitHub (master).
- GitHub webhook triggers Jenkins.
- Jenkins builds Docker image, deploys to k3s, runs tests.
- If tests fail, n8n/AI debugs and retries.
- If tests pass, workflow ends (email/reporting can be added later).

## 3. Key Features

- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Humans can define code structure and docstring contracts; AI implements logic.
- **Automated Consistency Check**: Ensures repo matches `requirements.md` before code generation.
- **Iterative Debug Loop**: AI debugs and updates code/tests/infrastructure until tests pass.

## 4. Next Steps

- Confirm this plan and provide your GitHub repository URL and authentication method (personal access token or deploy key) for implementation planning.
- Once ready, proceed to implement the n8n workflow, OpenAI integration, and Jenkins pipeline as described.
